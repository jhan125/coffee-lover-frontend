      <h2>Do you like Coffee?</h2>
      <p>Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has
        a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world
        market for hot drinks.
        .</p>
      <p>The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are
        roasted and then ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing
        a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and
        presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee).
        Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.
      </p>
      <p>The word coffee entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch koffie, borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish
        kahve (قهوه), borrowed in turn from the Arabic qahwah (قَهْوَة). Medieval Arab lexicographers traditionally
        held that the etymology of qahwah meant 'wine', given its distinctly dark color, and was derived from the verb
        qahiya (قَهِيَ), 'to have no appetite'. The word qahwah most likely meant 'the dark one', referring to the
        brew or the bean; qahwah is not the name of the bean, which are known in Arabic as bunn and in Cushitic
        languages as būn. Semitic languages had the root qhh, 'dark color', which became a natural designation for the
        beverage. Its cognates include the Hebrew qehe(h) ('dulling') and the Aramaic qahey ('give acrid taste to').
        Although etymologists have connected it with a word meaning "wine", it is also thought to be from the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaffa_Province" title="Kaffa"> Kaffa</a>
        province of Ethiopia, although the exact origin of the word is unknown.
